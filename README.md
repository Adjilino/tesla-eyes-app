# Tesla Eyes app
Developed by a Tesla's owner, that want to see the sentry mode event and dash cam clips like on the Tesla player.

This app still in progress. Missing some optimization, bugs fixing and improvements of the experience.

It's totally free and if you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/adjilino) I will be super grateful

Hope you enjoy this app.

**How to use**

The button "Add capture" open the *folder explorer* or *finder* and you should select the folder that contains the videos. 
The read process should take a little time, the app is reading the all files to get the all information needed.
